I ended up forking the repo from our group project so I could play around with it on my own and make some customizations. I wanted to tweak the styling and add some extra functionality without messing with the main group version. It was a good way to experiment and make it feel more personalized, especially since I could test out different ideas without worrying about breaking anything for the team. Overall, it was a solid way to end the semester and get some hands-on practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
