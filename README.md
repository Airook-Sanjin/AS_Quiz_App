This project was one of the last ones we worked on during the semester, and it was a pretty fun way to wrap things up. Itâ€™s basically a quiz creation and taking tool where you can build your own quizzes with custom questions and answers, and then take them in a separate interface. The cool part is that it uses session storage to save the quiz data, so you can move between pages without losing your progress.

I ended up forking the repo from our group project so I could play around with it on my own and make some customizations. I wanted to tweak the styling and add some extra functionality without messing with the main group version. It was a good way to experiment and make it feel more personalized, especially since I could test out different ideas without worrying about breaking anything for the team. Overall, it was a solid way to end the semester and get some hands-on practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
